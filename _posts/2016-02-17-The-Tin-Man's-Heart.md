## The Tin Man's Heart

Our latest project involved creating a predictive classification model from a real life dataset.  Our team used a dataset relating to heart disease from the excellent [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease).  

The dataset is comprised of patient information from medical institutes in 4 different locations- Cleveland (Ohio), Long Beach (California), Budapest (Hungary), and Zurich (Switzerland).  

Many machine learning studies have been done using this data to predict the presence or absence of heart disease, and a sample of these studies are below:
