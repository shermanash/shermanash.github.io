title: "Obtaining High-Quality Signatures"

As an exercise in exploratory data analysis, we broke up into groups to obtain, digest, and analyze data in pursuit of our stated objective.  The goal was to use MTA subway data, and other sources, to determine where, and when, to optimally place workers in order to recruit potential donors to an event supporting increasing the participation of women in tech.

Our initial reaction was to find the stations with the highest traffic, but we soon realized that high-traffic stations would not necessarily net the most high-quality signatures.  For example, a high traffic station such as Times Square may contain a large number of tourists, who wouldn't be able to attent the Gala and donate.  Penn station at 8:30 AM might have a ton of local commuters, who are also unwilling to stop and talk to our representatives.  We needed a way to determine how to balance high volume stations, with locations likely to yield quality signatures.

Our team eventually settled on using four factors to determine which stations to recommend.  The first was the average total weekly ridership for each station during a three month period.
