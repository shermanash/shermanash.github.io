My name is Andy Sherman-Ash, and I am currently a student at the [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.org) Data Science Bootcamp in NYC.  This blog will document my journey through the camp, concluding with a daily fantasy sports project that will hopefully become a useful tool for any DFS player.

### More Information

After graduating from WVU with a BS in Economics in 2011, I played poker professionally for the next 5 years.  I hope to use the skills gained from studying poker to help my transition to data science, and daily fantasy, as there is a large crossover between these three industries.
